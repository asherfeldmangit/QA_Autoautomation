# QA_Autoautomation

QA_Autoautomation is a framework that harnesses multiple Large Language Model (LLM) agents to automatically generate, implement, and review system tests for any given software system. This project aims to streamline and automate the QA process, reducing manual effort and increasing test coverage and reliability.

## Project Overview

This project orchestrates several specialized LLM agents, each responsible for a distinct phase of the automated testing workflow:

- **Test Case Generator Agent**: Analyzes the target system and requirements to generate comprehensive test case descriptions.
- **Test Case Coder Agent**: Converts generated test case descriptions into executable test scripts/code.
- **Test Case Reviewer Agent**: Reviews the generated test code for correctness, completeness, and adherence to best practices.

These agents collaborate in a pipeline to deliver high-quality, automated system tests with minimal human intervention.

## Workflow

1. **Input**: Provide the system under test and relevant requirements or documentation.
2. **Test Case Generation**: The Generator Agent creates detailed test cases based on the input.
3. **Test Coding**: The Coder Agent translates these cases into runnable test scripts.
4. **Test Review**: The Reviewer Agent inspects and suggests improvements to the test scripts.
5. **Output**: Ready-to-run automated system tests.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+
- See `pyproject.toml` for required dependencies (LLM APIs, agent frameworks, etc.)

### Installation
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # or use your preferred tool with pyproject.toml
   ```

## Usage

*Instructions for running the agent workflow will be added as the implementation progresses.*

## Directory Structure
